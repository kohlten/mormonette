42 stupidity redone in python...mormon style

All you have to do is clone it
Copy you dayXX folder into the sanme directory.
Replacing XX with your day number. For instance, day02 .. day12
Then run ./spawn.py.
It will copy all your current files provided they are in the proper exXX folder.
If you do not need to copy your files, you can just run the config file directly by either python config_dayXX.py or ./config_dayXX.py
I hope it helps you during your piscine!
